Publish it as npm package and also publish it as workflow action.

You need to a npm package CLI.

Also publish it as a github package.

3. Run ```npm install -g .``` to install the CLI. <br>

npm publish --access public

### Todo:
1. automate node publishing.
2. Add following workflows which should generate artifacts:
```
1. code coverage.
2. security vulnerabilities.
3. linting.
4. test cases report.
```

### To run test
```
npm test
npm i -g nyc
```
### Html report
Just use
```
nyc --reporter=html
```
instead of text. Now it will produce a report inside ./coverage/index.html.
